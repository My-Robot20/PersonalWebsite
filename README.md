# Personal Website

This website showcases things I love to do as well as my dev portfolio!

To run this site locally do the following below:



1. Install the dependencies: 
   `npm install -g npm`
   `npm install react-router-dom` 
   `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
    
    This will allow you to run the React app with React-Router and React-bootstrap. Bootstrap was only implemented for the Navbar feature.

2. Clone the repo with `git clone repo_url`

3. cd into the repo directory on your local machine: `cd PersonalWebsite`

4. Run `npm start`
